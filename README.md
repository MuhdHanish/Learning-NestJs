# NestJs Notes

## 1. Modules
1. Each application has at least one module - the root module. That is the starting point of the application.
2. Modules are an effective way to organize components by a closely related set of capabilities (e.g., per feature).
3. It is a good practice to have a folder per module, containing the module's components.
4. Modules are singletons; therefore, a module can be imported by multiple other modules.
